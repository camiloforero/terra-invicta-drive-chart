# Terra Invicta Drive Calculator

This tool should help calculate the optimal Terra Invicta drive, depending on your needs

Thanks to Sarah, who provided the drive formulae and general guidance, to redwah for the armor formulae, to Micro_NaCl and Elouda who put the effort into the graphs I originally used for my game and took inspiration from.
